# JuliaCon 2025 Minisymposium \label{juliacon25}

At JuliaCon Global 2025, we hosted an incredible Computational Chemistry and Materials Science Minisymposium, spanning topics from fundamental theory to cutting-edge applications. The minisymposium took place on July 25 at Lawrence Room 121 (Struct Room) at the University of Pittsburgh.
