## Quick Pitch Session
We’re reserving the last ~half hour for “quick pitches” of community projects. Since a major outcome of last year’s BoF session was the coordination of the team that built AtomsBase, we hope this minisymposium can be a catalyst for further such projects. So if you have an idea for a software project or other community effort of some kind (Seminar series? Workshop? Wikipedia edit-a-thon? Seriously, anything)  and are looking for a team to help make it happen, **LET ME KNOW!** You can get in touch via email (rkurchin at cmu dot edu) or [Slack](#slack).
