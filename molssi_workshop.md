# MolSSI workshop on Julia for Computational Molecular and Materials Science \label{molssi_workshop}

![MolSSI logo](/assets/molssi_main_logo.png)

The [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](https://molssi.org/) is generously sponsoring a workshop organized by [Rachel Kurchin](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kurchin-rachel.html) with the help of the JuliaMolSim community.

There are two core purposes to this workshop:
1. Convene users and developers of existing interfaces and packages to strengthen collaboration within the JuliaMolSim community.
2. Bring in perspectives of the broader computational molecular/materials science community to spur sharing of best practices and lessons learned and spark conversations about fruitful future directions and collaborations.

As such, if you are a computational molecular/materials scientist – and already a Julia user, or are just Julia-curious – we'd love to have you with us (either in-person or virtually)!

## Logistics and Registration
The workshop is **free to attend** and will take place at **Carnegie Mellon University** in Pittsburgh, PA from October 20-23, 2024, with a hybrid option for those unable to attend in person. [CLICK HERE](https://form.jotform.com/242276836566165) to register!

There is a discounted hotel block available at the nearby Marriott Courtyard Pittsburgh University Center; see the link in registration form to book.

If travel/lodging costs are a significant barrier for you, please reach out as soon as possible to discuss potential partial financial support options.

## Agenda (tentative)

Unless otherwise noted, all activities will take place in the Bosch Spark Conference Room (5201 Scott Hall).

### Day 0 (Sunday, October 20, in-person only): Intro to Julia
*To be as welcoming and inclusive as possible to attendees that are not already Julia users, we will kick off with a half-day accelerated introduction to the language targeted at an audience that is already proficient at programming in some other language.*

*If you already know Julia, you are still welcome to attend!*

**2:00-5:00** Intro to Julia ([Ethan Meitz](https://ethanmeitz.com/) and [Leticia Madureira](https://github.com/Leticia-maria))

### Day 1 (Monday, October 21, hybrid): State of the Ecosystem

*The first full day of the workshop will focus on the current interfaces (morning) and tools (late morning and afternoon) available in Julia for computational molecular and materials science.*

**8:30-9:00** Breakfast and introduction from Prof. [Rachel Kurchin](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kurchin-rachel.html)

**9:00-9:30** AtomsBase interface

**9:30-10:00** AtomsCalculators interface (Dr. [Teemu Järvinen](https://github.com/tjjarvinen))

**10:00-12:00** DFTK introduction and hands-on demo (Prof. [Michael Herbst](https://michael-herbst.com/))


**12:00-1:00** Lunch


**1:00-3:00** Molly introduction and hands-on demo (Dr. [Joe Greener](https://jgreener64.github.io/))

**3:00-3:30** Coffee break

**3:30-5:30** ACE and ACEPotentials introduction and hands-on demo (Prof. [Christoph Ortner](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~ortner/research/) and Dr. [Chuck Witt](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/chuck-witt))

**evening** Group dinner at [The Porch](https://www.dineattheporch.com/schenley)

### Day 2 (Tuesday, October 22, hybrid): Looking Outwards
*The second day will feature presentations on non-Julia interfaces and tools, with a focus on key design/governance decisions made along their development trajectories. In the afternoon, we will discuss together what the JuliaMolSim community can learn from these journeys.*

**morning** Exact agenda still TBD, but will include talks on tools and interfaces from the broader ecosystem including [QCSchema](https://molssi.org/software/qcschema-2/), [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/), [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/), and [AFLOW](https://www.aflowlib.org/)

**afternoon** Semi-structured discussions on future priorities, including planning for Wednesday hackathon!


### Day 3 (Wednesday, October 23, in-person and on GitHub): Hackathon!
*Taking inspiration from JuliaCon, we will conclude the workshop with a hackathon to begin working on projects including:*
* *Ideas brainstormed in discussions on Tuesday afternoon*
* *Existing issues in ecosystem packages*
* *Improving documentation -- a great place for newer Julia users to provide crucial input, especially since developers of many packages will be present!*
