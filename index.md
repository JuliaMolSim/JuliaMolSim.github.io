@def title = "JuliaMolSim: Molecular Simulations in Julia"

# JuliaMolSim

Your friendly organisation about molecular simulations in Julia.
We're currently working on setting up this website. You can also check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim)!

## Projects
Feel free to have a look at some of our projects:
- [ACEpotentials.jl](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEpotentials.jl): Interatomic potential learning using the Atomic cluster expansion; see also [ACEsuit](https://github.com/ACEsuit) for related packages.
- [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl): A Julian abstract interface for atomic structures.
- [DFTK.jl](https://dftk.org): A flexible code for density-functional theory simulations
- [Molly.jl](https://juliamolsim.github.io/Molly.jl/stable/): Molecular simulation in Julia
- [JuLIP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/JuLIP.jl): Julia Library for Interatomic Potentials
- [Libxc.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Libxc.jl): Julia bindings to the libxc library for exchange-correlation functionals
