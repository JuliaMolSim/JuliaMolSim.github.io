# JuliaMolSim

Your friendly organisation about molecular simulations in Julia.
We're currently working on setting up this website. You can also check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim)!

We're organizing a minisymposium at JuliaCon 2022. It will take place on July 22 from 1400-1700 UTC, and you can still participate by giving a "mini-pitch" â€“ see [agenda page](/juliacon22) for details
