We're organizing a minisymposium at JuliaCon 2022. It will take place on July 22 from 1400-1700 UTC, and you can still participate by giving a "mini-pitch" – see [agenda below](#juliacon22) for details

## JuliaCon 2022 Minisymposium \label{juliacon22}
Our JuliaCon 2022 minisymposium will take place on July 22 from 1400-1700 UTC. **We are still accepting "quick pitch" submissions, contact Rachel via email (rkurchin at cmu dot edu) or on the [Slack workspace](#slack) if you're interested!**

The agenda is as follows:

### Introduction
1400-1410: Introduction to JuliaMolSim, brief history of org with a focus on AtomsBase ([Rachel Kurchin](https://rkurchin.github.io))

### Talks from Projects using AtomsBase
Each talk will be 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes for Q&A/discussion.

* 1410-1430: [Chemellia](https://www.chemellia.org) ([Rachel Kurchin](https://rkurchin.github.io))
* 1430-1450: [Molly.jl](https://juliamolsim.github.io/Molly.jl/stable/) ([Joe Greener](http://jgreener64.github.io))
* 1450-1510: [DFTK.jl](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/) ([Michael Herbst](https://michael-herbst.com))
* 1510-1530: [CESMIX](https://computing.mit.edu/cesmix/) ([Emmanuel Lujan](https://www.emmanuellujan.com))

### Contributed Community Talks
Each talk will be 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes for Q&A/discussion.

* 1530-1550: [Fermi.jl](https://fermiqc.github.io/Fermi.jl/dev/) ([Gustavo Aroeira](https://github.com/gustavojra))
* 1550-1610: [ACE.jl](https://acesuit.github.io/ACE.jl/dev/) ([Christoph Ortner](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~ortner/))
* 1610-1630: [NQCDynamics.jl](https://nqcd.github.io/NQCDynamics.jl/dev/) ([James Gardner](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/people/james/))

### Quick Pitch Session
We’re reserving the last ~half hour for “quick pitches” of community projects. Since a major outcome of last year’s BoF session was the coordination of the team that built AtomsBase, we hope this minisymposium can be a catalyst for further such projects. So if you have an idea for a software project or other community effort of some kind (Seminar series? Workshop? Wikipedia edit-a-thon? Seriously, anything)  and are looking for a team to help make it happen, **LET ME KNOW!** You can get in touch via email (rkurchin at cmu dot edu) or [Slack](#slack).

## Projects
Feel free to have a look at some of our projects:
- [ACE.jl](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACE.jl): Atomic cluster expansion in Julia
- [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl): A Julian abstract interface for atomic structures.
- [DFTK.jl](https://dftk.org): A flexible code for density-functional theory simulations
- [Molly.jl](https://juliamolsim.github.io/Molly.jl/stable/): Molecular simulation in Julia
